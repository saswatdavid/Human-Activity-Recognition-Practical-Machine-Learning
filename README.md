# Human Activity Recognition - Practical Machine Learning
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, data is collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants - asked to perform barbell lifts in 5 different ways - correctly and incorectly. he goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise, i.e. Class A to E.

This is done as the course project of Practical Machine Learning course offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera.
